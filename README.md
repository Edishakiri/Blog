Hello,
at the outset, I would like to thank the user Safak for his help with the project.


The React Blog Project is helpful in improving your own programming skills, it is not meant to be used on the website.


If you want to review the project,
it is worth starting with installing Axios by entering "npm add axios" in the terminal,
of course after downloading the files to your disk.





To run the project, go to the "api" folder and enter "npm start" in the terminal, of course we do everything in VS Code,
then we will run our backend.
When we have it behind us,
exit from Api to the main folder and also enter "npm start" in the terminal,
thanks to which we will be able to move freely on the finished page.
The blog is also linked to MongoDB.



If you want to do a similar project and improve your own skills,
I recommend you the YouTube channel of the user "Lama Dev" from where I got inspiration and code.
